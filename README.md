# E-Mail Spam Filter ML App

This Project is a E-Mail Spam Filter ML App.

It uses machine learning models to predict whether the email is spam or ligitimate.
In this project, I have developed a simple E-Mail Spam Filter ML App which is using a Spam Filter Predictor api to provide us the status of our E-Mail as Spam or Not based on copy & pasting the E-Mail which we want to check.

For Developing the project I have used Flask Framework as base. I have used HTML and CSS for developing basic structure of the project. All the coding part is implemented using Jupyter Notebook and Python Language.

## Tools used for project development:

  * Python ( 3.7 version)
  
  * Jupyter Notebook

  * Flask

  * Seaborn
  
  * SkLearn

  * Pandas

  * Numpy

  * HTML

  * CSS
  
 ## For using the project use the following commands :
  * $ git clone
  * $ set FLASK_APP= app.py
  * $ flask run
  
The whole project is deployed on Heroku Cloud.
